# My Documentation Portfolio Website

<p> This is the source code for my documentation portfolio website, which showcases my technical writing and documentation skills. The website is built using Next.js, a React-based framework for building server-side rendered web applications, and TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. </p>

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/.

Once Node.js is installed, you can use the following commands to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/codergalib20/documentation-portfolio.git
cd documentation-portfolio
npm install
```

## Running the Website Locally

To run the website locally, you can use the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server, which will automatically reload the website as you make changes to the code.

## Building and Deploying the Website

To build and deploy the website, you can use the following commands:

```
npm run build
npm run start
```

The `npm run build` command will generate a production build of the website, which can be deployed to a web server or hosting platform.

The `npm run start` command will start a production server that serves the built website. You can then access the website by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
